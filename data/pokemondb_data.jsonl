Its thick fangs are hollow like straws, making them unexpectedly fragile. These fangs are specialized for sucking blood. Sometimes they drink so much blood, they can\u2019t fly anymore. Then they fall to the ground and become food for other Pok\u00e9mon. Every once in a while, you\u2019ll see a Golbat that\u2019s missing some fangs. This happens when hunger drives it to try biting a Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon. They can suck down over 10 ounces of blood in one go.

At night, it patrols its territory with its eyes aglow. It loves things that sparkle. When it sees a shiny object, the gold coin on its head shines, too. The pattern that has appeared on its giant coin is thought to be the key to unlocking the secrets of the Dynamax phenomenon. Its body has grown incredibly long and the coin on its forehead has grown incredibly large\u2014all thanks to Gigantamax power. This Pok\u00e9mon was not originally found in Alola. Human actions caused a surge in their numbers, and they went feral. They\u2019re prideful and crafty. When its delicate pride is wounded, or when the gold coin on its forehead is dirtied, it flies into a hysterical rage. It\u2019s impulsive, selfish, and fickle. It\u2019s very popular with some Trainers who like giving it the attention it needs. A royal house that flourished in the distant past brought it here from another region. Meowth is both selfish and prideful. Highly intelligent and prideful, it\u2019s famously difficult to handle\u2014but that\u2019s also a reason for its popularity. It\u2019s accustomed to luxury because it used to live with Alolan royalty. As a result, it\u2019s very picky about food. Deeply proud and keenly smart, this Pok\u00e9mon moves with cunning during battle and relentlessly attacks enemies\u2019 weak points. Living with a savage, seafaring people has toughened this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body so much that parts of it have turned to iron. These daring Pok\u00e9mon have coins on their foreheads. Darker coins are harder, and harder coins garner more respect among Meowth."}

Slowpoke uses this trait to lure in and fish up other Pok\u00e9mon. Although slow, it is skilled at fishing with its tail. It does not feel pain if its tail is bitten. It is incredibly slow and dopey. It takes five seconds for it to feel pain when under attack. It is always vacantly lost in thought, but no one knows what it is thinking about.

This Pok\u00e9mon uses its round tail as a float. The ball of Marill\u2019s tail is filled with nutrients that have been turned into an oil. Even after Marill swims in a cold sea, its water- repellent fur dries almost as soon as Marill leaves the water. That\u2019s why this Pok\u00e9mon is never cold. Using its tail as a float, it dives underwater. It likes eating plants that grow in riverbeds. The tip of its tail is filled with oil that is lighter than water, so it acts as a float. The fur on its body naturally repels water. It can stay dry even when it plays in the water. The oil-filled tail functions as a buoy, so it\u2019s fine even in rivers with strong currents."}

The liquid is thought to be something like greasy sweat. This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s habitat shapes its physique. According to some theories, life in warm ocean waters causes this variation to develop. Subjecting this Pok\u00e9mon to a strong force causes it to secrete a strange purple fluid. Though harmless, the fluid is awfully sticky. Shellos lives in the sea and feasts on plankton. The lovelier the ocean where Shellos resides, the more vibrant its color becomes. The difference in color from one Shellos to another seems to be a result of their diet. No large changes can be seen in their capabilities. When it senses danger, it gushes a purple liquid. Some theories suggest this liquid is a greasy sweat induced by stress. Scientists interested in its great regenerative capabilities are currently analyzing the materials from which its cells are made. There\u2019s speculation that its appearance is determined by what it eats, but the truth remains elusive. Its appearance changes depending on the environment.
